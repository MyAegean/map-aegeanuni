## About /map/

### A quick view over the university units

<p>This map application consists of 7 pointers that show some info &amp; details regarding the <a href="http://www.aegean.gr" target="_blank" title="University of the Aegean">University of the Aegean</a> infrastructure. A visitor can see some information related to the specific schools/departments (official sites) as well as some forum discussions on the student community of My.Aegean.gr that also relate to the specific schools/departments. There is also a pointer that zooms into the unit that is situated in Athens, a building that includes administration services and offices. This is a static map application, that can be expanded to include some interactive material and services as well</p>

<p><strong>Fork it!</strong> We encourage the optimization and development of this simple idea by expanding its possibilites and serving as a point of reference and providing fruitful information regarding the university units. Please feel free to contribute here and support it further!</p>

<p>We will support the expansion of the project and update it on: <strong><a href="http://my.aegean.gr/map/">my.aegean.gr/map/</a></strong> </p>

## About MyAegean

<p>The idea of <em>"my Aegean"</em> originated in 2002 with a group of students from the University of the Aegean. The aim of this initiative was to create a network portal for the whole of the Aegean University community by utilising any available technology.<br>Our aspiration is to create <strong>a vehicle which will encourage and promote direct, collective and qualitative communication and information exchange, without geographical restrictions, among all members of the Aegean community</strong> (students, academic and research staff, as well as administrative, technical or other personnel). <em>myAegean</em> is to serve as a common point of reference, as a scheme which will stimulate and facilitate interaction among all the members of the university.</p>
